Characters with a Daimonic Aspect gain a +1 modifier when interacting with other esoteric beings and can choose if his or her Daimonic aspect conveys Awe or Fear.

It is a subtle ability as it affects others indirectly and not by the character performing specific actions - although it may enhance the desired effect of activities such as intimidation. Whenever a character chooses to mesmerise, they must select a particular emotion to convey or quench in the subjects, for instance diminishing feelings of aggression or inspiring feelings of passion. Mesmerise does not compel specific actions nor direct the subjects&rsquo; reactions to the emotional inducement. For example, stirring emotions of attraction may make subjects inclined to act affectionate, but there is no certainty that the character will be the target of the affection. Mesmerise affects the immediate area as long as the character remains focused.

The subject interprets the suggestion - they are not puppets - so may not act as intended, but they will react to it in some way. Ambiguous suggestions cause confused reactions from the recipient; therefore, the specific phrasing of the suggestion is important.
