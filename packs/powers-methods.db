It is believed that the essence of the sacrificial creature is passed on through a ritualistic and ceremonial consecration of its blood allowing hidden powers to be released and conferred to a recipient. A living creature is sacrificed, and the blood is consecrated, offered or ritually consumed, thereby conferring the innate powers of the blood to the recipient, granting a temporary ability, bonus or advantage. The consecration or offering often takes the form of baptism in blood, the drawing of symbols upon the body or the ingestion of the blood.</p>","ranks":0},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"cSyZplijlQPqH8p0"}
{"name":"Blood Rituals - Sacrificial Divination","permission":{"default":0,"RrWQxiSTW954To8L":3},"type":"method","data":{"description":"<p>The use of sacrificial divination revolves around the examination of entrails and blood of a sacrificial animal to&nbsp; declare a response to an inquiry about supposed fortune,&nbsp; insight or providence. A question is put forward during the&nbsp; sacrificial rite and the entrails and blood-flows of the creature&nbsp; display a series of encouraging and discouraging properties&nbsp; indicating a positive or negative response. The more&nbsp; profound the question, the larger or more sophisticated the&nbsp; sacrificial animal must be to provide a clear answer, and&nbsp; occasionally there is no creature massive enough to give a&nbsp; proper basis for an answer. The future, however, is always&nbsp; unclear and wisdom granted through blood rituals may not&nbsp; be certain; as events unfold, fortunes change and so do the&nbsp; answers in sacrificial rites.&nbsp; Each ranking of Sacrificial Divination also cost three (3)&nbsp; character points. The first ranking in sacrificial divination&nbsp; grants the practitioner fundamental knowledge of a few&nbsp; basic rituals and the ability to superficially read the signs in&nbsp; sacrificial divination. As the character gains further rankings,&nbsp; he or she can obtain increasingly detailed information as&nbsp; well as more precise answers to a wider range of inquiries.&nbsp; A sacrificial divination ritual is made by making an Intellect&nbsp; or Awareness roll with the added blood rite ranking against&nbsp; a difficulty determined by the query&nbsp; posed. If the roll equals or exceeds&nbsp; the difficulty, the ritual is a success, if&nbsp; the roll fails something went awry, and&nbsp; nothing happens while a critical failure&nbsp; causes a backlash.</p>","ranks":0},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"ebdaKLrQgc4QpHFJ"}

Gnostics may subtract their Intellect modifier from calamity rolls, but they are unable to acquire sphere rankings higher than their Intellect score. For many Gnostics meditation is an integrated part of focussing their mental energies when invoking their powers. Meditation takes time but once done it decreases the difficulty of channelling, 160 making it easier for the Mystic to create taxing or challenging phenomena. Gnostic mystics may perform preparatory meditations, reducing the difficulty of the phenomenon by one per half hour spent in meditation. The meditation must pertain to a chosen phenomenon which must be completed instantly after the meditation. The amounts of hours which can be spent meditating are limited to the character&rsquo;s Intellect modifier. Many Gnostics use ritualistic chants and ceremonial gesticulations to enhance their focus; characters with the Ritual skill may add a +1 modifier to their channelling roll.</p>","ranks":0},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"hd5WjetsAhh60P7x"}
